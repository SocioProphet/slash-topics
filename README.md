# slash-topics

Slash topics are governed, signed, replayable “scopes” for search and knowledge surfaces.

This repo turns the blekko-era idea (explicit scoping via `/topic`) into 2025-grade commons infrastructure:
- topic packs as signed artifacts
- policy membranes as enforceable gates
- deterministic receipts for audit/replay
- TritRPC alignment for cross-language interoperability

Start in:
- HISTORY.md (origins + motivation)
- docs/SlashTopics.md (the spec overview)
- specs/*.json (normative schemas)
- protocols/ (versioned packs)
- policies/ (default governance bundles)
