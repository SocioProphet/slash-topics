# Slash Topics

A **slash topic** is a governed public object that scopes search/knowledge execution.

## Conceptual layers (blekko bones, modern organs)
1. Slash topics (topical scopes): `/science`, `/computers`, `/reference`
2. Operators (built-ins): `/date`, `/dr=YYYY-YYYY`, etc.
3. Integrations: external calls are explicit + sandboxed
4. Preferences: in 2025 this is privacy + governance posture

## 2025 requirements (non-negotiable)
- Topic packs are versioned artifacts with content hashes
- Packs and policies can be signed and federated
- Membranes enforce allow/deny/quarantine/redact/require-signature
- Every execution emits a deterministic receipt (or declares bounded nondeterminism)
