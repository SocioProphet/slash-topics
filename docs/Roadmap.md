# Roadmap

Immediate hardening (no fluff):
1) Canonicalization rules: exact hashing/serialization + signing coverage.
2) Membrane decision model: standardized outputs + required audit fields.
3) Protocol bundling: versioned topic pack artifacts + manifests + hashes.
4) Workflow harness: FA representation + replay checkpoints + execution receipts.
5) TritRPC fixtures: canonical frame fixtures for cross-language interoperability tests.
